          Between debugging code and brainstorming the next viral tweet or
          video, I like to keep things fun. Exploring content creation and
          storytelling has become a creative outlet, letting me connect with an
          amazing community while showcasing my passion for design, tech, and
          sometimes the occasional gaming session.
