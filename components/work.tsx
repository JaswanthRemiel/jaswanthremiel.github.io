          I, as a passionate and driven individual, actively contributed to
          impactful projects while fostering technical communities and honing my
          skills in web development, AI, and cloud technologies. Additionally,
          as a freelance designer, Iâ€™ve delivered high-quality solutions,
          earning over $500 QRR, and actively contributed to open-source
          projects like Appwrite during Hacktoberfest, showcasing my commitment
          to innovation and collaboration.
          <p>
            My collaborative efforts in the open-source community reflect my
            passion for innovation and creating value through technology. I'm
            passionate about designing digital experiences that make people say
            "wow" and building web applications more stable than a server after
            a reboot. My work experience includes leading projects at Samsung
            R&D India, contributing to impactful research at IIT Palakkad, and
            fostering technical communities as a Microsoft Learn Student
            Ambassador.
